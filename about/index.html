                        <div>
                            <p>I am enthusiastic towards user experience design,
                            mobilility, and cloud technology. Being a student from
                            Purdue University, I have been trained to think
                            differently and develop on existing ideas. I love
                            the design aspect of software; it is the factor that
                            contributes to the attractiveness and usefulness of a
                            system. How an application was designed could affect
                            how millions of users use it, and potentially
                            change how people interact with the surroundings.</p>

                            <p>My design style is pro-simplicity. I dislike randomly
                            stitching pieces of unknown artworks or pseudo-materials
                            together and call it a design. It is not. A good design is one that
                            can resonate with the users' minds; that they can easily
                            learn how the application functions. Skeuomorphism has
                            been deeply implanted in many of the designers' minds;
                            although it is not a bad approach, the thought has inevitably
                            created many designs that, compared to their simplicity
                            counterparts, do not provide any usability at all.</p>

                            <p>The not-so-geeky side of me is consisted of classical
                            concerts, computer games, and brisk walking. I also enjoy
                            reading fiction novels and tech news. Few years ago,
                            Japanese was added into my list of hobbies. I do love
                            learning languages, and it is one of my dreams to learn
                            at least 5 different languages (not programming languages),
                            besides Chinese and English.</p>

                                A web module for specifying cellular APN configurations. This module was
                                particularly challenging because it required generalizng data from other
                                teams and processing them into XML documents that were readible by the system.<br/></p>

                            <p>The position at Blackberry was challenging. When I was employed,
                            the company was undergoing a huge transition, and they were preparing internal
                            services for the new Blackberry 10 operating system. Since the system differed
                            from the original Java based OS, many configuraitons and templates for hardware
                            settings were needed to be updated. My team was responsible for centralizing
                            these information, and this shift made us extremely busy.</p>
                            <p>I was responsible for designing and implementing several modules for the
                            web tool that we maintained. The web tool served as a platform for internal
                            employees to search for device and process information, thus any change will
                            affect thousands of employees and carrier representatives worldwide. After
                            creating each module, I always produced detailed documentations on the process,
                            database schemas, and reasons why I chose to implement the logic. I also needed
                            to communicate with several teams for additional web services requests and
                            specifications.</p>

                                Database management system. In this project I went through the entire process
                                of software development, including pre-design technology researches, interviews
                                with target users, and the post-design usability experiments, application
                                implementation, and quality assurance testings.<br/></p>

                            <p>My placement at P&P Optica was the first computer related professional
                            position in my life. Because of my inexperience in software development,
                            I was frightened when my supervisor handed me my first project - building
                            the company's first specialized database management system. It was frustrating
                            in the first few weeks, but the project taught me many things about software
                            design and development.</p>
                            <p>My interests towards user experience design sprouted during this project.
                            I implemented many of my ideas, but came to realize that the elements may not
                            necessarily suit the needs of the actual users. I performed several usability
                            tests with the target groups, and interated through several prototypes. I enjoyed
                            analyzing the needs of the targets because sometimes they did not even understand
                            that their workflow was inefficient. It was the joy from helping them achieving
                            higher productivity that truly motivated me as I developed the system.</p>
                            <p>The final project of the term involved developing a graphing library that
                            visualized spectrum data acquired by spectrometres. The project was challenging
                            and interesting, and I understood many of the core elements of Java through this
                            assignment. In the end, I was also responsible for enhancing the usability and
                            visual design of the application.</p>
