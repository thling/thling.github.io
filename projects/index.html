                            <p><b>Switch Without Extra Page Load</b><br/>
                            The plugin allows in-page view switching without any extra page
                            load. This will result in a more fluid website viewing experience.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>Extendability</b><br/>
                            The code will be completely open, and the styles and core functions
                            will be factored in a way that is easy to integrate. The built-in
                            loaders (<code>loadMore()</code> and <code>loadBack()</code>) can be
                            easily associated with any front end components.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Switcher Layout is an easy way to implement in-page contents
                        switching; it is being used every where in this website. It provides
                        fast way to switch sections without reloading the page. In my website,
                        you can experience it by pressing left or right arrow key or click on
                        the More and Back button on the top of the pages.</p>
                        <p>Switcher Layout is created as a by-product of the redesign of my
                        personal website. At first, I was experimenting with different ways
                        to display my contents; in order to make browsing faster, I decided
                        to remove as many page loads as possible. This, however, results in
                        clogging the entire page with information, and I needed a way to
                        separate these contents into different views.</p>
                        <p>The result is this layout. It consumes everything as "section,"
                        allows user to define a default section, and pushes everything aside
                        and hide them. By using one of the <code>loadMore</code> and
                        <code>loadBack</code> functions, it goes through a series of integrity
                        checks and then applies jQuery <code>animate</code> function to dismiss
                        the current section and summon the next section.</p>
                        <p>This solves the long-page problem by categorizing similar information
                        into their own sections, yet it creates another issue: there is no
                        way in this layout to skip to a certain section without manually clicking
                        on More and Back buttons. I was stunned for a few minutes, yet I suddenly
                        recalled how request parameters are passed using Ajax. Why don't I simply
                        specify section names in the URL, parse it, and recusively call <code>loadMore</code>
                        function?</p>
                        <p>I attempted the idea, and it was successful since the first implementation
                        (because, to be honest, it was super easy). Currently, user simply specify
                        the key to the section in the URL by adding <code>?section=[section_name]</code> and
                        the layout will apply loadMore function until the section is displayed.</p>

                            <p><b>Automatic File Name Matching</b><br/>
	                        If the name of the files in the directory consists of some
	                        numeric patterns, the tool will detect the pattern and rewrite
	                        the strings accordingly.</p>

		                    <p><b>Prefix</b><br/>
	                        Allows the user to rename files with a prefix. For example,
	                        <code>img_20121221_066</code> to represent the 66th (<code>066</code>) image file
	                        (<code>img</code>) taken on December 21, 2012 (<code>20121221</code>).</p>

		                    <p><b>Digit Filling</b><br/>
	                        Fills the file name to a specified length of digits. For example,
                            <code>1.png</code> &rarr; <code>001.png</code>, <code>32.png</code>
                            &rarr; <code>032.png</code> when digit fill is set to 3.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>To talk about this project, I would like to first introduce
                        to you my dear digital point-and-shoot camera. This camera is
                        actually really nice; it shoots static images well and performs
                        excellently at low light situations. Its video recording is also
                        top-tier (of most of the digital cameras I have used), although the
                        sound quality is subpar. I am pretty satisfied with this camera,
                        until I learned that there is no proper way to automatically
                        format the image names except for brute forcing (renaming files
                        one by one).</p>

			            <p>This is a problem to me. I am (at least I think) a very organized
			            person, physically and virtually. That is, I always keep my files
			            organized with some sort of naming convention then group similar
			            items into one directory. Of course, to rename each file is not a
			            big issue, yet it becomes cumbersome if I happen to go on a trip.
			            Imagine renameing few hundreds (or maybe over a thousand) photos!
			            This is insane!</p>

			            <p>So, I decided to take a few minutes and compose a shell script
			            that renames each photo into the name I want. This tool has eventually
			            been rewritten into a Java program with graphical user interface and
			            several functionalities. To name a few features:</p>

                        <p>This project was a requirement of CS 449: Human-Computer Interaction course.
                        Students form in to HCI teams of 3 or 4 and, using Contexual Design, redesign
                        a group of real world professionals' workflows. Our group chose to work on this
                        project with individual financial advisors.</p>

                        <p>We set up interviews with our subjects and guide them into describing their
                        daily tasks in detail. It was difficult to interview for information because
                        every word we said could affect the direction of the subject's speech. A misuse
                        of phrase may mislead the interviewees, which can confuse them in the end
                        and make them unwilling to provide information.</p>

			            <p>We carefully conducted all of our interviews and returned to group meetings
			            with extensive data. We analyzed the information and identified the tasks
			            that are better off without technology and eliminated them. We then proceeded to
			            examine the breakdowns within work flows, and discovered that there were
			            several repeated steps in the subjects' current records management methods.
			            We decided to work on solutions that address this issue. After a 3-hour
			            brainstorming session, the white board in our study room was overwhelmed with
			            ideas and features. We trimmed down the set and concluded with an redesigned workflow.</p>

			            <p>The system incorporates uses of Anoto pen and a digital contents management
			            system designed specifically for the advisors and their tasks. We demonstrated
			            the workflow to our subjects and professor and received positive feedbacks with
			            some criticism. We then reiterated through several other prototypes and eventually
			            resolved majority of the concenrs that the subjects had.</p>

			            <p>In this webpage, links to our write-ups were provided. Phase 1 includes data
			            analysis from our interviews with the subjects and phase 2 includes proposed work
			            redesigns and low fidelity prototypes. The Final Report was written
			            in standard CHI format and concludes everything with our final design.</p>

			            <p>A link to the GitHub repository that contains our final working prototype was
			            also provided. You can also download the Java Archive (requires JRE 7 and above).
			            For the purpose of this course, we also prepared a short video summarizing our
			            project; it is available on YouTube, recorded and editted by Marina (Mengqi) Zhao.</p>

                            The module supports whole-object undo/redo, as well
                            as function sequence based undo/redo (instead of storing
                            the object, the module executes a list of user specified
                            functions upon redo or undo operation).</p>

                        <p>As I was doing a side project (a trading card game, now deprecated),
                        I found that in most cases the "card maker" program that I created
                        required several undo and redo actions. It is annoying that, whenever
                        a mistake was made, I had to restart the entire card making process.</p>

		                <p>I paused the trading card game project and began focusing on
		                an undo and redo module. At first, I thought it could be simply a
		                stack that simply returns the last object in the list, but I soon
		                realized that there were more to it. I needed to take care of type
		                conversion, redo sequences, and several other elements that, without
		                them, the module would not be functional.

		                <p>I spent more time into researching dynamic typing in Java and other
		                list and abstact functions optimization. I also implemented a few algorithms
		                that could increase object retrieval and memory management. Many things were
		                done in order to make the module easily integrated into other systems, and
		                I was thrilled when I finally finished the framework. In addition to
		                core operations, I also provided a custom Java Swing object, <code>hList</code>,
		                that displays a list of operations pushed to stack when triggered.</p>

		                <p>Everything was good, until I found out that Java actually had its own built-in
		                undo and redo library. I felt devastated when I realized that because I spent
		                weeks working on this module. Although it was depressing, I still felt that
		                the experience I obtained through the intense programming was invaluable.</p>
